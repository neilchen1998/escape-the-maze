# Escape Mazes Project

# Overview

This project presents using **dynamic programming**
to solve shortest path problem. In this project, there are two
different sets of problems. The first set is the *Known Maze* problem
and the second one is the *Unknown Maze* problem. Those mazes are provided by
The Minigrid library [1].

# Installation

The environments (mazes) can be installed by using the following command:

`pip install minigrid`

# Mazes

We use 7 different mazes in total to test our path finding algorithm.
Here are some of the mazes that we use:

- doorkey-5x5-normal
